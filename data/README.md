## data folder
1. boards: initial games to be solved and parent node in the optimisation algorithms.
2. results: separated into results by heuristics or no heuristics per algorithm.

### boards
4x4 grid testboard
- game0.csv
**6x6 grid boards**
- game1.csv
- game2.csv
- game3.csv
**9x9 grid boards**
- game4.csv
- game5.csv
- game6.csv
**12x12 grid boards**
- game7.csv

### results
Different folders for the algorithms.
- breachbound
- breadthfirst
- depthfirst
- random
The folders contain a results folder for each game#number with heuristics and without. Best run and standard results (to be) appended.
