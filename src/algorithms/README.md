To run the algorithms they get called on from the main.py

### random.py
Random algorithm goes through all possible moves without soft constraints.

### breadthfirst.py
Breadth First Search algorithm: Iterates over the entire depthlevel before proceding to the next to find a guaranteed best solution.

### depthfirst.py
Depth First Search algorithm: Iterates over as deep as possible until it hits a dead end and backtracks to a previous unique state with multiple unused moves, that move to other unique states.
